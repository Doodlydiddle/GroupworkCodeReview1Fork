<h1> Positive Applications of Computer Science </h1>
<h3>
    Robots in Medicine
</h3>
<p>In 2020, the CMR Surgical's Versius robot was used by NHS hospitals for the first time.</p>
    
<p>The Western General Hospital in Edinburgh and the Milton Keynes University were the first to use it.</p>
<p>Versius is designed to help with minimal access procedures which is done with small incisions to the body</p>
<p>Versius may be able to help carry out 700 keyhole surgeries every year.</p>
<p>Advantages of keyhole surgery over open surgery include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Longer and more painful recovery
    <li>Greater infection risk


</ul>

<p>The robots were used in colorectal surgeries to help those with bowel disease and bowel cancer</p>
