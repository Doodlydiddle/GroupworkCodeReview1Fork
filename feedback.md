Interest of Content 
- Excellent 
- Content is very interesting, covering a wide variety of computer science fields. Website is supposed to be about positive benefits, but there is a page on negative impacts. Author details were only links, not giving a lot of information about the author.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation 
- Very Good
- Design overall is pleasant and positively impacts user experience. Page design is not consistent, with layout changing for every page. Most pages use a monochrome colour scheme, although Luke's page differs as it has a background colour. Fonts vary with the pages. Images make pages more exciting, although one did not work. 

Quality of written presentation 
- Very Good 
- Overall content is very good and clear. Raine's page has a few issues; all the line spacing makes it difficult to read and the starts of the lines go off the screen a bit. Luke's page has a typo "prescenddent". Missing space in first paragraph on Nneka's page, as well as typo "inovations".

Validity of HTML 
- Good 
- Most pages were okay with very few errors, but some had catastrophic errors due to syntax errors or unnecessary repetition of code. See FEEDBACK comments in files. Navbar didn't function when going to or from Nneka's page.

Evidence of collaboration 
- Very Good
- GitHub history suggests that all author details were done by the writer of the page and not another team member. Done well in advance of deadline. Even contribution between all team members, with Billy taking the lead and adding Bootstrap and navbars to all the pages. Billy deleted another group member's page
